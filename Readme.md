# EmailReceiver

This is a demo/showcase ("quick and dirty").

This small SwiftUI app opens a main window with a drop area where you can drop a mail from Apple Mail.

The app then will save the E-Mail in the Downloads folder.

Implementation: [ContentView.swift](MailReceiver/ContentView.swift)

Works on macOS 15.6.1.
